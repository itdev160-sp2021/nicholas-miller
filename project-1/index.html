            <p>With 3 solo albums(The 18th Letter, The Master and The Seventh Seal) Rakim is widely known in the hip community as the "God MC"
                That is due to his mic presence and lyrical talent that puts him at the top of hip hops food chain. His rhyme patterns are one of a kind
                and haven't been topped even in 2021. He also spent some time with Eric B the producer and released the albums -

            <p>Once labeled a skateboard rapper and once tried to be signed by Jay Z, Lupe is up there with the greats due to his diversity when
                it comes to lyricism, story telling, rhyme play, etc. He excels at all the above and goes beyond the measures to produce double entendres
                like no other MC I've heard.

            <p>A legend in the underground and a well respected MC all around by all. His unorthodox
                flow is what makes him so exciting and at the same time unique as well. He also worked with Madlib to produce one of
                the cult classic hip hip albums online titled "Madvilliany." Recently he passed away but his legend will always live on.

            </figure>
            <p>Kool G is known for using multisyllabic rhymes that are on par with his swift delivery
                with impeccable breath control that rivals no one. He is a legend that also incorporates the mafioso
                style towards his rhymes.

            <p> Nas can be considered one of the closest MCs to emulate Rakims style. He has a way of making the street life seem lavish. His innovation 
                with story telling behind his rhymes makes him one of a kind.
